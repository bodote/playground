# change java versions in Intellij for a project:
Not only you need to change it in `File>ProjectStructure>Project` AND in `File>ProjectStructure>SDK` but
also in `GradleWindow>Gradle settings...>Gradle>GradleJVM`

## check java version used during build and at runtime:
- gradle : `println("java version: "+ JavaVersion.current());`
- Java sourcecode : `String version = System.getProperty("java.version");
  logger.info("JavaVersion="+version);`
